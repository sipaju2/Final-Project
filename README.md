Process:

   - Clean up data :
        After loadoing all data from my differents source, we needed to clean data since there was some empty ligne or Nan.
        
   - Analysis 
        After Cleaning out data and merge some tables with Pandas, we used Maplotilb and Tableau to Analyse our data
        
   - Vizualisation
        After Analyzing the data we used Html, Js and Css to present our result or to facilitate the vizualisation of our          research.
        
   - Make powerpoint slides for final presentation
 
 # Bonus
 
  - Predictioon of future Prices if trends remain the same.
        After all the analysis, we needed to predict what will be the Median Housing Price if all the conditions remains the same. (Here the  base on the input of the User the housing price will vary base on the Year and its keep growing, we used A linear Regression here)
